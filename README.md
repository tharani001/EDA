Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding your dataset before diving into modeling or drawing conclusions. Documenting your EDA process in the `README.md` file on GitHub helps others understand the dataset and the insights gained from it. Here's how you can explain EDA in the `README.md` file:

1. **Introduction**: 
   - Start by introducing the dataset briefly. Mention its source, purpose, and any relevant background information.

2. **Overview of EDA**:
   - Explain what EDA is and why it's important.
   - Emphasize that EDA helps uncover patterns, trends, anomalies, and relationships within the data.

3. **Steps of EDA**:
   - Describe the steps you took during EDA. Common steps include:
     - Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
     - Summary Statistics: Provide statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., for numerical features.
     - Data Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to explore the distribution and relationships between variables.
     - Correlation Analysis: Determine the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
     - Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
